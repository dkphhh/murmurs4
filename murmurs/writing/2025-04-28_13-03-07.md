> 主持人：我想知道乔布斯的热情所在，是什么在激励他？

> J: I read an article when I was very young, in the Scientific American, and it measures the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet, so for you know for bear, chimpanzee, raccoon and birds, and fish, how many calories per kilometer they spend to move, and humans was measured too, the condor won, it was the most efficient, and the mankind, the crowned creation, came in with rather unimpressive showing about 3rd way down the list, but somebody there had the brilliance to test a human riding a bicycle, blew away the condor, all the way off the charts, and I remember this really had an impact on me, I really remember this - humans were tool builders, and we build tools that can dramatically amplify our human abilities. To me, we actually went an ad line earlier with Apple, that the personal computer was the bicycle of mind, and I believe that with every bone in my body, that of all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near, if not at the top, as history unfolds if we look back, and it is the most awesome tool that we ever invented, and I feel incredibly lucky to be at exactly the right place in silicon valley, at exactly the right time, historically where this invention has taken form.

> 乔布斯：我小时候曾在《科学美国人》上拜读过一篇文章，文中对比了地球上各种不同物种的移动速率，比如熊、猩猩、浣熊、鸟类、鱼类等——当然还有人类——计算它们每移动一公里消耗的热量，最后秃鹫赢了，它的移动效率最高。作为万物之灵的人类，排在倒数第几位。但是杂志特地测量了人类骑自行车的速率。结果把秃鹫远远甩在了身后，在排名上遥遥领先。这篇文章给我留下了深刻的印象，人类擅长发明工具，工具赋予我们奇妙的能力。苹果以前有一条广告：计算机是头脑的自行车，我彻头彻尾地坚信如果将来有人回顾人类历史，计算机将是人类最伟大的发明。能在硅谷参与这项发明，我觉得自己很幸运。
