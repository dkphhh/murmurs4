> For me, programming has always been more than a skill. It’s a way to explore, to tinker, and to satisfy curiosity. From wires and screwdrivers to apps, the tools have changed. But the impulse remains. That’s why I keep coming back to it. It’s my natural way of interacting with the world.

对我而言，编程不仅仅是一项技能。它是一种探索、思考和满足好奇心的方式。从电线和螺丝刀到应用程序，工具一直变，冲动依旧在。这就是为什么我不断回到编程中来，它是我和世界交互的方式。
